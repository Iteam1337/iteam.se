### Having fun, producing value, doing something good

These are our core values. And they are not just pretty words. We use them as a template for deciding whether an assignment is worth taking on. We work in a business capable of producing value on orders of magnitude. Life is too short to be scratching the surface, we want to dig.

### An inclusive, diverse environment

We believe that diverse experiences and opposing views strengthen and evolve our capacity to solve problems. It also makes life at work more rewarding and fun. We want to maintain an environment where people who never fit in, people who always fit in and anyone in between, can work together and enjoy each other’s company. And we try to achieve it but demanding not consensus but respect.
