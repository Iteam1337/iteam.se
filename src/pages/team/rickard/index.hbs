      content: "In the early 90's my family got its first 286, it was love at first sight. In my teen years I played a lot of Delta Force and started developing the clan websites. Until I started at KTH I only did minor hobby projects. There I managed my chapters website and assisted younger students in MATLAB. This is when I realized what I really wanted to work with, building beautiful websites."
